#SQL Project: Monday Coffee Data Analysis

# Objective
#The goal of this project is to analyse Monday Coffee's sales data, a
#company that has been selling its products online since January 2023, and
#to recommend the top three major cities in India for opening new coffee
#shop locations based on consumer demand and sales performance.  
#Activity 1: Data Loading
 #How do you create the tables for customers, 
 #products, and sales in the database?
 #Customers Table
 Use customers;
  CREATE TABLE Customers1 (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    Phone VARCHAR(20),
    Address VARCHAR(255),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    Country VARCHAR(50),
    CreatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

 #Products Table
CREATE TABLE Products2 (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    StockQuantity INT DEFAULT 0,
    CreatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

  #Sales Table

CREATE TABLE Sales1 (
    SaleID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    CustomerID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT NOT NULL,
    SaleDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

#Activity 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
#● How can you identify null values in your dataset?
#Check nulls in each column of Customers

Alter TABLE Customers;

#For Sales table

#● How can you check for duplicate entries in the customers table?
#To find exact duplicates (based on Email, FirstName, LastName)

#Activity 3: Data Transformation & Integration
#Once the data was clean, we proceeded to join the tables to create a comprehensive view for
#analysis.
#● How do you create a comprehensive sales report with 
#customer and product details?

#Activity 5: Decision-Making & Recommendations

#(b) Final Recommendations
#● What are the final recommendations for expanding Monday Coffee shops?
#Based on the analysis (Activities 1–4), the recommendations would look like:
#Expand in High-Potential Cities
#Focus on the top 3 cities that show strong performance across sales, customers, and transactions.
#These cities not only generate revenue but also have a loyal and diverse customer base.
#Leverage Product Demand Insights
#Expand menu offerings for high-demand products in each city (identified in Activity 4e).
#Localize inventory management to match city-specific preferences.
#Enhance Customer Experience
#Target cities with high average order value by offering premium coffee experiences and loyalty programs.
#Focus on cities with strong ratings (Activity 4g) to build reputation further.
#Seasonal & Trend Alignment
#Use monthly sales trend analysis to identify peak seasons (Activity 4f).
#Align promotions, staffing, and inventory with these demand cycles.
#Data-Driven Expansion Strategy
#Roll out pilot stores in top cities first, measure performance, then scale gradually.
#Keep monitoring customer feedback (ratings) to adapt offerings.
